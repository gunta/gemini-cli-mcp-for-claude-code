# DXT Setup Complete âœ…

Desktop Extension (DXT) support has been successfully added to the Gemini CLI MCP for Claude project!

## What Was Configured

### 1. DXT CLI Tool
- âœ… Installed `@anthropic-ai/dxt` as dev dependency
- âœ… Added npm scripts:
  - `bun run dxt:init` - Initialize manifest interactively
  - `bun run dxt:pack` - Build and pack the DXT extension
  - `bun run dxt:validate` - Validate manifest.json

### 2. Manifest Configuration
- âœ… Created comprehensive `manifest.json` with:
  - Server metadata and description
  - Tool listings (7 tools)
  - User configuration options
  - Compatibility requirements
  - Prompts and keywords

### 3. GitHub Actions
- âœ… **Dedicated DXT Release Workflow** (`dxt-release.yml`):
  - Triggers on GitHub releases
  - Builds and packs the DXT
  - Uploads as release asset
  - Generates installation instructions

- âœ… **Updated Publish Workflow**:
  - Now also builds DXT on npm publish
  - Automatically attaches DXT to GitHub releases

### 4. Documentation
- âœ… Created `DXT_README.md` with:
  - Installation instructions
  - DXT structure explanation
  - Troubleshooting guide
  - Development workflow

### 5. Project Updates
- âœ… Updated `.gitignore` to exclude `.dxt` files
- âœ… Created `assets/` directory structure for icons
