## Welcome to Gemini CLI MCP for Claude

Give Claude Desktop and Claude Code access to **Google's COMPLETE media generation suite** - capabilities Claude completely lacks. This MCP server is a superset of Google's own mcp-genmedia, providing ALL the tools Claude needs for multimedia creation.

## What Claude Can't Do (But Now Can!)

Claude has **ZERO** native capabilities for:

- 🎨 **Image Generation** - Now powered by Imagen 3
- 🎬 **Video Creation** - Text-to-video and image-to-video with Veo 2
- 🎵 **Music Composition** - Professional music with Lyria
- 🗣️ **Speech Synthesis** - Ultra-realistic voices with Chirp 3 HD
- 🛠️ **Media Processing** - Complete FFmpeg toolkit

## Features at a Glance

### 🧠 Enhanced Text Generation
- **1M token context window** (5x Claude's limit)
- **Multimodal support** for images in prompts
- **Google Search integration** for real-time information
- **Latest model**: gemini-2.0-flash-thinking-exp-1219

### 🎨 Image Generation (Imagen 3)
- Photorealistic image generation
- Multiple aspect ratios (1:1, 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, 3:4)
- Batch generation (up to 4 images)
- Cloud storage support

### 🎬 Video Generation (Veo 2)
- Text-to-video generation
- Image-to-video animation
- Multiple aspect ratios and durations
- Veo 3.0 preview support

### 🎵 Music Generation (Lyria)

## Why This Matters

With this MCP server, Claude becomes a **complete multimedia production suite**. You can:

1. **Generate** content in any medium
2. **Process** and manipulate media files
3. **Combine** different media types
4. **Create** professional productions

All from within Claude's familiar interface!

## Why This MCP Server?

### The Problem with Other Gemini MCP Servers

There are many MCP servers that wrap Gemini's capabilities. But here's the thing - **they all miss the point**.

Most Gemini MCP servers simply expose the API without context. This means:
- You have to manually tell Claude when to use Gemini vs its own capabilities
- You need to maintain documentation about what Gemini is good at
- Claude doesn't know which tool to use for which task
- You end up with a disconnected experience

### Why This One is Different

**This MCP server is self-aware and Claude-aware.**

Every tool description explicitly tells Claude:
- When Gemini is SUPERIOR (1M tokens vs 200K)
- What capabilities Claude COMPLETELY LACKS (images, video, music, speech)
- Why it should use each specific tool

For example, our text generation tool doesn't just say "generate text". It says:
> "SUPERIOR capabilities vs Claude: 1M token context window (5x larger than Claude's 200K)"

This means Claude automatically knows to use Gemini for:
- Large documents that exceed its context window
- Any media generation task it can't do natively
- Complex multimodal inputs

### No More CLAUDE.md Maintenance

With other MCP servers, you'd need to constantly update your CLAUDE.md file:
```markdown
# When to use Gemini
- For documents over 200K tokens
- For image generation (Claude can't do this)
- For video creation (Claude can't do this)
- etc...
```

**With this MCP server, that's all built-in.** Claude knows exactly when and why to use each tool.

### Complete, Not Just Connected

This isn't just a thin wrapper around Gemini's API. It's a **superset** that includes:
- All of Google's media generation models (Imagen 3, Veo 2, Lyria, Chirp 3 HD)
- Complete FFmpeg toolkit for media processing
- Batch operations and cloud storage
- Tools that even Google's own MCP implementation doesn't have

### The Result?

You get a Claude that:
1. **Knows its limitations** and automatically uses Gemini to overcome them
2. **Chooses the right tool** without you having to specify
3. **Works seamlessly** as if these capabilities were native

No configuration. No maintenance. No confusion.

Just a Claude with superpowers.
