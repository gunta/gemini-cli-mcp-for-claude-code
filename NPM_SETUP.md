# NPM Publishing Setup Complete âœ…

The `gemini-cli-mcp-for-claude` package is now fully configured for npm publishing!

## What Was Set Up

### 1. Package Configuration
- âœ… Added proper npm metadata (`exports`, `types`, `files`, `engines`)
- âœ… Added comprehensive keywords for discoverability
- âœ… Set author information
- âœ… Created ISC LICENSE file

### 2. Publishing Scripts
- `bun run publish:npm` - Publish to npm (requires login)
- `bun run publish:dry` - Test what would be published
- `bun run changeset` - Create a new changeset
- `bun run version` - Version packages based on changesets
- `bun run release` - Build and publish to npm

### 3. Version Management with Changesets
- Installed and configured `@changesets/cli`
- Created initial changeset for v2.0.0
- Set up for public access publishing

### 4. GitHub Actions
- **Automated Release** (`publish.yml`): Triggers on push to main
- **Manual Release** (`manual-release.yml`): Allows manual version bumps

### 5. Publishing Documentation
