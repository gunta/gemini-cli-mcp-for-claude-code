          # Installing Gemini CLI MCP for Claude

          ## Option 1: Using DXT File (Recommended)
          
          1. Download the \`.dxt\` file from the [latest release](https://github.com/gunta/gemini-cli-mcp-for-claude-code/releases/latest)
          2. Open Claude Desktop
          3. Go to Settings â†’ Extensions
          4. Click "Install Extension" and select the downloaded \`.dxt\` file
          5. Configure your Gemini API key or CLI path when prompted

          ## Option 2: Manual Installation

          See the [README](https://github.com/gunta/gemini-cli-mcp-for-claude-code#installation) for manual installation instructions.

          ## Configuration

          After installation, configure the extension with either:
          - **Gemini API Key**: Set \`GEMINI_API_KEY\` environment variable
          - **Gemini CLI Path**: Set \`GEMINI_CLI_PATH\` to your gemini CLI executable

          ## Verifying Installation

          1. Restart Claude Desktop
          2. Ask Claude: "What media generation capabilities do you have?"
          3. Claude should mention Gemini, Imagen, Veo, Lyria, and Chirp capabilities

          ## Troubleshooting

          If the extension doesn't load:
          1. Check Claude Desktop logs for errors
          2. Ensure Node.js 18+ is installed
          3. Verify your Gemini credentials are set correctly
