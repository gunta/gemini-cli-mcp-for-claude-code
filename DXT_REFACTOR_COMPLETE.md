# DXT Refactoring Complete âœ…

Successfully restructured the project to create optimized DXT packages!

## What Changed

### Before (Problem)
- DXT was packaging the entire project directory
- Package size: **42MB** (included tests, docs, dev dependencies)
- Unnecessarily large for distribution

### After (Solution)  
- Created dedicated `mcp-server/` directory for DXT packaging
- Package size: **20MB** (52% reduction!)
- Clean, production-only build

## New Structure

```
gemini-cli-mcp-for-claude-code/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                    # Source code (unchanged)
â”œâ”€â”€ dist/                   # Dev build output
â”œâ”€â”€ mcp-server/            # DXT packaging directory
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ manifest.json      # DXT manifest (moved here)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ mcp.json          # MCP config (copied here)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ package.json      # Minimal runtime deps only
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dist/             # Production build output
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ node_modules/     # Runtime dependencies only
â””â”€â”€ package.json          # Main project file

```

## Updated Commands

```bash
# Build for development (unchanged)
bun run build

# Build for MCP/DXT distribution
bun run build:mcp

# Create DXT package (now builds in mcp-server/)
bun run dxt:pack

# Validate manifest
bun run dxt:validate
```

## Build Process

1. `build:mcp` uses `tsconfig.mcp.json` to compile to `mcp-server/dist/`
2. Excludes test files and dev dependencies
3. `dxt:pack` installs production deps and creates optimized package

## Benefits

- âœ… 52% smaller DXT packages (20MB vs 42MB)
- âœ… Cleaner separation of dev vs production
- âœ… Faster installation for end users
- âœ… No test files or dev tools in distribution
- âœ… Maintains all functionality

## GitHub Actions

Updated both workflows:
- `publish.yml` - Builds DXT from mcp-server/
- `dxt-release.yml` - Looks for DXT in mcp-server/

## Testing

Successfully tested:
- âœ… Manifest validation passes
- âœ… DXT builds without errors
- âœ… Package contains all necessary files
- âœ… Size reduced from 42MB to 20MB

The refactoring is complete and ready for production use! ðŸš€
